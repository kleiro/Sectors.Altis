---ToDo:
1. Change loadouts to on/off, with specific loadouts like pistols only being separate arrays in inventoryDefines

2. Create killfeed

3. Add force first person options

3. MAKE MOAR LOADOUTS!!!!! :D


---FSM's:
1. sectorChange - runs when a sector changes sides and then finds all groups assigned to it and selects a new waypoint based on their set behavior, also adds/deletes respawn points for each side

2. unitMove - runs to constantly move ai towards their waypoint, even during combat

3. reEval - runs for each strategic and defense group to determine if they should switch objectives if the current one has not been taken within x amount of time



---Aggressive FSM Branch
1.Find all triggers in front of group (distance between trigger and enemy base is less than distance between group and enemy base)
2. If there are triggers in front, attack the closest one, if there are not, attack the closest trigger to the rear
3. If no triggers owned by the enemy exist, move to the trigger closest to the enemy base

---Defensive FSM Branch
1.Find the closest unowned trigger to the main base and attack it
2. If there are no unowned triggers, the group will wait at the current trigger for 15 seconds, or as long as a majority of the group's units are in combat mode until selecting the next nearest trigger to the friendly base to attack
3.If the trigger taken by the enemy was not assigned to the group, and it is closer than the trigger the group is moving to, then attack the trigger freshly taken by the enemy

--Strategic FSM Branch
1.Find out which enemy triggers enemy groups are closest to
2. Select the enemy trigger with the lowest enemy presence and is closest

60/40 split is .918
